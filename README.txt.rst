FFMPEG and Mencoder builder is a `buildout <http://www.buildout.org>`_ based script to automatically
download FFMPEG and MPlayer, configure them and compile them for your usage.

Both have dependencies to various codec libraries. Due to copyright and patent reason,
distributing working binaries on all platforms is difficult.
